- **Permissions and Sharing**: Supports public or private sharing links for easy file distribution.
- **Task Processing Center**: Supports asynchronous task processing, such as file indexing and data backups, without impacting the main application.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Using Docker Compose is the most recommended way to start Foxel.

1. **Create Data Directories**:
Create a `data` folder for persistent data:

```bash
mkdir -p data/db
mkdir -p data/mount
chmod 777 data/db data/mount
```

2. **Download Docker Compose File**:

  ```bash
  curl -L -O https://github.com/DrizzleTime/Foxel/raw/main/compose.yaml
  ```

  After downloading, it is **strongly recommended** to modify the environment variables in the `compose.yaml` file to ensure security:

- Modify `SECRET_KEY` and `TEMP_LINK_SECRET_KEY`: Replace the default keys with randomly generated strong keys.

3. **Start the Services**:

  ```bash
  docker-compose up -d
  ```

4. **Access the Application**:

  Once the services are running, open the page in your browser.

  > On the first launch, please follow the setup guide to initialize the administrator account.
